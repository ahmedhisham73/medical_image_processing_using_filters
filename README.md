# medical_image_processing_using_filters

In this simple medical imaging application , we tried to build a simple medical imaging processing application using monai framework,.

-First we were in need to test medical images , fortunately there is radiopaeda which is an opensource pedia for medical images

-This is a normal brain MRI from sagittalT1 view ,the MRI is in PNG format which facilitates the mission.

-Second we have to define the most common operations to be performed upon this MRI , refering to MONAI they used 3 image processings techniques ,
which are Guassian , Sobel and median operations 

-Third after applying the three operators the result was as shown

-Fourth the Application needs to be packed in order to be converted into Docker image for production , thanks to MONAI SDK for making this step easier 


-Repository structure is as follows 
1-filter adding to medicalimage -> main development code and the application file 
2-input -> input images used to test the filters 
3-output -> output results after filters operations 
4-execution and packaging -> script to package the application into a container 
5-application_Docker file -> Docker container that carries and includes application files for ready made usage
